budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.title = Budgeting for your Self Assessment tax bill - video transcript
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.heading = Budgeting for your Self Assessment tax bill - video transcript
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph1 = This is one of a series of videos about online Self Assessment.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph2 = Why is it so important to budget for payments to HMRC early on? Well, HMRC wants you to pay the right tax, at the right time.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph3 = Depending on when you first start self-employment, it can be some time before you get your first tax bill. Added to that, if your bill for tax and class 4 National Insurance is over £1000, your first bill will be one and a half times what you owe as you also need to make a payment on account.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph4 = Don’t worry though as this is going towards next year’s tax bill. It’s really easy to budget for these payments as HMRC offers a ‘Ready Reckoner’ tool. Just search GOV.UK. When you get to this page click ‘start now’. Using the ‘Ready Reckoner’ tool is easy. Just enter an estimate of your self-employed profit for the month and it will give you an idea of what to put aside towards your tax and National Insurance bill. However, it’s important to be aware, that although it’ll give you an idea of what to pay, it only covers income from self-employment.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph5 = For example, some people stay in employment while they start their business just to see how things go. Once you know what you want to pay, go online and you can set up a budget payment plan via direct debit.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph6 = As long as you are up to date with previous Self Assessment payments, you can make regular payments in advance. It’s really flexible. You can stop paying if you want to. You need to remember though, that if you’ve not paid enough to cover your bill in full you’ll still need to pay the difference by the deadline. Budgeting helps with cash flow because you can see exactly how much is going out of the business at any time.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph7 = Because you have an idea of how your business is doing, you can also decide whether to reduce the payment on account. You’ll find more help and support on GOV.UK.

selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph2 = Remember you should send and pay your online tax return by 31st January, if you don’t you’ll usually be charged a penalty.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph3 = You can check if you need to send a tax return by using our Self Assessment checker on GOV.UK.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph4 = If you do need to send one and we receive your return late you’ll get a penalty of one hundred pounds [£100] if your tax return is up to three months late. These penalties won’t be reduced, even if you have nothing to pay on your return.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph5 = If it’s more than three months late you’ll be charged an additional ten pounds a day for up to ninety days.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph6 = After this you’ll be charged further penalties until we receive your tax return and you’ve paid your tax bill.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph7 = You’ll also be charged interest on late payments.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph8 = If you don’t have to send a tax return you can ask to be removed from Self Assessment through your personal tax account.

tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph2 = Once you’re in the online tax return you need to ‘Tailor your return’.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph3 = Three pages, of Yes/No questions ensuring that you’re only given the sections you need.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph4 = Page 1 is about the sources of income you had, for example employment, self-employment or partnership income.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph5 = If you’re unsure about a question, select the ‘question mark’.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph6 = You’ll then be given guidance.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph7 = You must select ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to all questions on these pages.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph8 = When you choose ‘Yes’, you may be asked for further information.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph9 = For example, if you choose ‘Yes’ for the employment section, you’re asked how many employments or directorships you had, and you have to give the employer’s name.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph10 = You don’t have to complete your return all in one go. Once you have answered the questions on a page and selected ‘Save and continue’, you can leave and come back later which can be helpful if you don’t have everything to hand.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph11 = ‘Save and continue’ takes you to page 2. This asks about other types of income like bank interest, dividends and pensions.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph12 = This question can cause confusion – it’s for losses on other taxable income such as casual earnings or commission. It’s not for losses you would enter in another section of the return, for example, self-employed losses in the self-employed section. If in doubt use the question mark.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph13 = Page 3 is mainly about tax reliefs, including pension contributions, charitable gifts, Married Couple’s Allowance and Marriage Allowance.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph14 = This is not refunds you’ve received during the tax year for an earlier year, or refunds through an employer. It’s the 2017-18 tax you’ve paid, which has already been refunded by HMRC or Jobcentre Plus.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph15 = ‘Save and continue’ takes you to ‘Fill in your return’. From here you’ll be taken to the sections you need, to give the details of the income you had and any tax you paid.
tailorYourTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph16 = Remember the tax return due on 31 January 2019 is for the tax year 6 April 2017 to 5 April 2018. Any tax you owe must be paid by 31 January 2019.

yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.heading = Your self-employed tax return - video transcript
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph1 = This is one of a series of videos about online Self Assessment tax returns.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph2 = You’ve tailored your return. Now tell HMRC about your self-employed income.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph3 = The first question is about your annual turnover.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph4 = If you didn’t trade for a full year, but had you, and your income would’ve been over £85,000, you answer “yes”.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph5 = For example:
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph6 = If your business income over 6 months was £50,000, then for 12 months it would’ve been £100,000.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph7 = If your trading income is over £85,000 then you may need to register for VAT.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph8 = You’ll also need to give detailed information, such as listing expenses.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph9 = We’re choosing ‘no’.

yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph11 = Your business description goes on page 2.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph12 = If you started or ceased self-employment during the year, it’s important to enter the dates so HMRC can update your records.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph13 = This next page is for your accounting details. Enter your end of year date. When you start self-employment we recommend you use 5th April as this is the end of the tax year.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph14 = Consider cash basis. If you answer ‘Yes’, you may not be able to make claims for some expenses, capital allowances and loss relief.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph15 = Use the question mark for guidance or search for cash basis on GOV.UK.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph16 = On this page, show your turnover and allowable expenses.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph17 = This is where you can claim the new £1,000 trading allowance. If you use this allowance you can’t deduct any other expenses or capital expenses.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph18 = If you don’t use the trading allowance and your income is below the VAT threshold, just add together all the allowable expenses and enter a single figure, or you can enter them separately.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph19 = The calculations are done automatically.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph20 = You’re then taken to the Capital Allowances page.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph21 = With cash basis, you can only claim capital allowances on business cars.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph22 = Other tax adjustments are on the next page. Include the value of any goods or services you’ve had for your own use, any losses brought forward from an earlier year and any other business income.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph23 = The next page is for losses. There’s a link to a worksheet and helpsheet 227 with more guidance. These aren’t sent to HMRC.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph24 = You only need to complete the tax deducted page if you’re in the construction industry scheme to show contractor deductions.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph25 = Only answer ‘Yes’ if you’re exempt from Class 4 National Insurance contributions. The few exemptions are listed.
yourSelfEmployedTaxReturnTranscript.paragraph26 = There’s a screen for other information, then check your entries on this summary page.
