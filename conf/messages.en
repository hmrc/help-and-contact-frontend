budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.heading = Budgeting for your Self Assessment tax bill - video transcript
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph1 = This is one of a series of videos about online Self Assessment.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph2 = Why is it so important to budget for payments to HMRC early on? Well, HMRC wants you to pay the right tax, at the right time.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph3 = Depending on when you first start self-employment, it can be some time before you get your first tax bill. Added to that, if your bill for tax and class 4 National Insurance is over £1000, your first bill will be one and a half times what you owe as you also need to make a payment on account.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph4 = Don’t worry though as this is going towards next year’s tax bill. It’s really easy to budget for these payments as HMRC offers a ‘Ready Reckoner’ tool. Just search GOV.UK. When you get to this page click ‘start now’. Using the ‘Ready Reckoner’ tool is easy. Just enter an estimate of your self-employed profit for the month and it will give you an idea of what to put aside towards your tax and National Insurance bill. However, it’s important to be aware, that although it’ll give you an idea of what to pay, it only covers income from self-employment.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph5 = For example, some people stay in employment while they start their business just to see how things go. Once you know what you want to pay, go online and you can set up a budget payment plan via direct debit.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph6 = As long as you are up to date with previous Self Assessment payments, you can make regular payments in advance. It’s really flexible. You can stop paying if you want to. You need to remember though, that if you’ve not paid enough to cover your bill in full you’ll still need to pay the difference by the deadline. Budgeting helps with cash flow because you can see exactly how much is going out of the business at any time.
budgetingYourSelfAssessmentTaxBillTranscript.paragraph7 = Because you have an idea of how your business is doing, you can also decide whether to reduce the payment on account. You’ll find more help and support on GOV.UK.

selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph2 = You may have heard there are penalties if your tax return is sent to HMRC late. You need to be aware that you should submit and pay your online tax return by 31 January.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph3 = You’ll usually be charged a penalty if you’re late.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph4 = Here’s how to find out more. Search GOV.UK for ‘Self Assessment tax returns’. And then select ‘penalties’. You’ll see that you’ll be charged a £100 penalty if your tax return is up to 3 months late, there’s also penalties if you pay your tax bill late.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph5 = Further penalties are added if you are more three months late with the return, or if you still haven’t paid. These can soon add up.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph6 = There’s a calculator to help you work out what the penalties might be. Select ‘Start now’, then choose the year and follow the steps through to get an estimate of what you could be charged in penalties.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph7 = For example, this is an estimate if your tax return for 2015-16 was submitted 6 months late, online on 31 July with the tax paid the same day.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph8 = Of course, you can avoid any penalties by doing your tax return and paying anything you owe well before 31 January.
selfAssessmentPenaltiesTranscript.paragraph9 = Customers also tell us they are worried that a penalty will be charged if they make a mistake on the return. This depends on whether you have taken reasonable care when you have completed it. Keeping accurate records to fill in your tax return will help to avoid this.
